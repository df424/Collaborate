Project for Drexel University Software Design (CS575)

This project requires that you run "npm install" after cloning it.  This will rebuild
the node_modules folder.

To start the automatic angular build process use the command "npm run build"
then leave the process running.

To start the node.js web server use the command "npm run start"
